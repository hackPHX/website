    {
      "title": "What is a hackathon?",
      "answer": "A hackathon is an event that brings together engineers, designers, developers and anyone with good ideas into the same space for a brief, intense period of collaboration to create a game. Participants will have 12 hours to build their HTML5 game, in teams of 5 or 6, and show it off to the judges at the end the event. The best games will be awarded prizes and our sponsors will be providing something for everyone."
    },
    {
      "title": "What are the rules?",
      "answer": "The rules are to create a compelling game using HTML5 technologies within the time frame. Games will be judged on gameplay, design, use of HTML5 technologies and *wow* factor, so make sure to be creative!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Who can participate?",
      "answer": "Anyone that is enthusiastic about making cool stuff, hacking, collaborating with others and enjoys a little competition. You do not have to be only a programmer or engineer to participate. Many different types of people are needed to make a game! If you are interested in game creation, then we recommend you sign up!"
    },
    {
      "title": "What if I am new to programming or am not a programmer at all?",
      "answer": "Thatâ€™s okay! Many skillsets are needed to make a game. Everyone is here to learn and have fun. We plan to be providing a bootcamp before the hackathon begins to teach people the basics of HTML5 game creation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do I need a team or idea to sign up?",
      "answer": "You do not need a team to sign up, and we are actively going to try pairing experienced and non-experienced people and evenly distribute skillsets. Having an idea is helpful, but not required. Remember, each team can only submit one project!"
    },
    {
      "title": "What should I bring?",
      "answer": "You will need a laptop and charger that you can program on. We will be providing WiFi and power cords."
    },
    {
      "title": "How long is a hackathon?",
      "answer": "This hackathon is 12 hours with a 2 hour bootcamp prior."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do I have to be at the hackathon the entire time?",
      "answer": "No. We actually recommend that people take breaks from their work to stretch and get refreshed, but all coding must be done on site since it is a competition."
    },
    {
      "title": "Is food provided?",
      "answer": "Yup! We will be providing lunch, dinner, snacks and maybe even energy drinks and beers throughout the competition for participants free of charge. If you have a special dietary need (gluten-free, vegetarian, etc) or food allergy - please <a href=\"mailto:info@hackPHX.com\">email</a> us! We will be more than happy to work with you."
