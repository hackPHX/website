    {
      "title": "What is a hackathon?",
      "answer": "A hackathon is an event that brings together engineers, designers, developers, entrepreneurs and anyone with good ideas into the same space for a brief but intense period of collaboration to create usable software. Hackathons typically focus on creating hacks or applications for web or mobile platforms. Participants have anywhere from 12 to 48 hours to build something awesome, whether as individuals or in teams, and show it off at the end the event."
    },
    {
      "title": "What are the rules?",
      "answer": "We don't want to limit creativity. Rules will vary depending on the different topics of types of hackathons (hardware vs software). For instance hardware hackathons may have budget constraints."
    },
    {
      "title": "Who can participate?",
      "answer": "Anyone that is enthusiastic about making cool stuff, hacking, collaborating with others and enjoys a little competition. You do not do not have to be only a programmer or engineer to participate, though you should have some coding experience. We want people from all different backgrounds - you can be a student, hobbyist, artist, professional, etc. If you know how to code a little and are interested, then we recommend you sign up!"
    },
    {
      "title": "What if I am new to programming?",
      "answer": "That’s okay! Everyone is here to learn and have fun. This will be great learning experience and many people will be willing to help you out along the way. We will be providing a bootcamp beforehand of tech talks that cover various skills that will be useful to bring people up to speed quickly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do I need a team or idea to sign up?",
      "answer": "No. You can sign up without a team! Do not worry, there will sessions to help people connect with others to form teams and find team members. There will also be workshops to help teams brainstorm and generate ideas on what to work on."
    },
    {
      "title": "What should I bring?",
      "answer": "You will need a laptop and charger that you can program on. Wear comfortable clothes! Bring toiletries, cell phone, and pillow for comfort. We recommend people bring a power cord – circuit breakers are great! Check the event page of the hackathon you are attending to make sure if there are any other technology specific requirements you need."
    },
    {
      "title": "How long is a hackathon?",
      "answer": "Our hackathons are all day events that last for 12 hours."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do I have to be at the hackathon the entire time?",
      "answer": "No. We actually recommend that people take breaks from their work to stretch and get refreshed, but all coding must be done on site since it is a competition."
    },
    {
      "title": "Is food provided?",
      "answer": "Yup! We will be providing breakfast, lunch, dinner, snakes and even energy drinks throughout the competition for participants free of charge. If you have a special dietary need (gluten-free, vegetarian, etc) or food allergy - please <a href=\"mailto:info@hackPHX.com\">email</a> us! We will be more than happy to work with you."
