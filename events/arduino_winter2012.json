  "questions": [
  {
     "title": "What is a hackathon?",
     "answer": "A hackathon is an event that brings together engineers, designers, developers, entrepreneurs and anyone with good ideas into the same space for a brief but intense period of collaboration to create something awesome. Particpants have 12 hours to design and implement something, whether as individuals or in teams, and show it off at the end the event."
   },
   {
     "title": "What are the rules?",
     "answer": "Rules will be limited. There will be a secret ingrediant and an Arduino and each team will have small budget to add whatever you want from Radio Shack, Walmart, Craigslist, etc. The idea is to not make this a quest to find out who has deeper pockets, but what you can do with your creativity. Judges will be on hand if you'd like to clear something through them, and at the end of the day they will pick their favorite. That being said there will be a Jury prize too, so maybe breaking the rules will be worth it :)."
   },
   {
     "title": "Who can participate?",
     "answer": "Anyone that is enthusiastic about making cool stuff, hacking, collaborating with others and enjoys a little competition. You do not do not have to be only a programmer or engineer to participate, though you should have some Arduino experience. We want people from all different backgrounds - you can be a student, hobbyist, artist, professional, etc. If you know how to code a little and are interested, then we recommend you sign up!"
   },
   {
     "title": "Do I need a team or idea to sign up?",
     "answer": "You can sign up without a team. There will be a morning session to help people connect with others to form teams and find team members. There will also be workshops to help teams brainstorm and generate ideas on what to work on."
   },
   {
     "title": "What should I bring?",
     "answer": "You will need a laptop and charger that you can program on. We'll provide the hardware :) "
   },
   {
     "title": "How long is a hackathon?",
     "answer": "This is a 12 hour event."
   },
   {
     "title": "Do I have to be at the hackathon the entire time?",
     "answer": "No. We actually recommend that people take breaks from their work to stretch and get refreshed, shop, etc, but all coding must be done on site since it is a competition."
   },
   {
     "title": "Is food provided?",
     "answer": "Yup! We will be providing lunch, dinner, snacks and maybe even energy drinks and beers throughout the competition for participants free of charge. If you have a special dietary need (gluten-free, vegetarian, etc) or food allergy - please <a href=\"mailto:info@hackPHX.com\">email</a> us! We will be more than happy to work with you."
